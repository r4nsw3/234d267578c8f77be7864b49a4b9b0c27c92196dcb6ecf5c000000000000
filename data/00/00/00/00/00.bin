  |   FighterZ Tournament is a new, online tournament mode featuring        |
  |   various new match rules, culminating in a final 8-player bracket.     |
  |   The winners and runners-up in each tournament will receive special    |
  |   rewards and Z Trophies, the latter of which players can display in    |
  |   their all-new Z Trophy Room.                                          |
